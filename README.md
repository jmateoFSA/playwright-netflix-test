# Instructions

Creating a basic test on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) using JavaScript and Microsoft's [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) framework.

1. Install node modules by running `npm i`.

2. Create a basic [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#first-test) test that goes to [netflix.com](https://www.netflix.com) and verifies that you cannot sign in with an invalid email/password combination. Add your code to the `tests/netflix.spec.js` file after the `// ADD YOUR TESTS HERE!` comment. The command `npm run test` will run your test.

3. Optional: If you want to add an assertion, you can use Playwright (example docs [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#writing-assertions)).
